<p>This is Ken learning HTML at Panera Bread with Ryan.  It is still decently cold outside but that won't last.  Not sure where Ryan wants to go to eat after this, hopefully it will be cheap - like McDonalds</p>
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, at home, Cody is molesting Keith and making him do dirty things.  Perhaps he is making Keith eat one of his bully sticks!  aka Bull Pizzle</p>
